Module 3 Challenge - PyBank and PyPoll
PyBank - Reads through a csv file with date (Mon/Date) and total of bank statments monthly. Counts the total months of bank statements and collects the difference between each month. Average, Max Increase, and Max Loss are calculated along with the date it occurred. 
PyPoll - Reads through a csv file with Voter ID, County, and candidate of Choice. Counts the number of votes each candidate racked up and is saved on a dictionary for reference. Compares the number of votes each candidate and saves which candidate is in the lead. Percentage of votes to total votes is also saved in the dictionary for more information. 

My Path runs through my Mac Desktop on the following directory
- #/Users/ana/Desktop/python-challenge/PyPoll/Resources/
- -#/Users/ana/Desktop/python-challenge/PyBank/Resources/

Output is printed on terminal and written on a txt file under analysis folder.
